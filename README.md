  Chinese idiom question answering system based on open sources.
Chinese idioms is a unique culture of China, are often express
something as clearly or as cleverly. For Chinese teenagers
and children, it is very important to learn idioms. From
the perspective of learning efficiency, a question answering
system of Chinese idioms is better that the traditional book
reading system, especially for children. Therefore, providing
a question answering system that can make children interact
with the idiom system through speech to easily and fast
complete the learning process is necessary.

Open source used in the system are shown as follows:

•  ASRT. It is a Auto Speech Recognition Tool based on
deep learning, including models that trained by using a
large number of Chinese Speech data sets and transcribed
into Chinese Phonics by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Connectivity sequential classification
(CTC) methods.

• DTW. DTW is an algorithm for measuring similarity
between two sequences which may vary in time or speed,
which is often used to build isolated word recognition
system.

• TTS. TTS is a type of speech synthesis application that
converts files stored on a computer, such as help files or
web pages, into natural speech output.

• Pyaudio. Pyaudio provides a Python version of PortAudio, a cross platform audio I/O library that allows you to
play and record audio in Python programs.
• Database API. Data querying API is the function or
program fragment for querying, updating and managing
relational database systems.

• MCFF API. MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) AIP is the function or program fragment for
calculating MFCCs of speeches.

• Hamming Distance API. Hamming Distance API is the
function or program fragment for calculating the hamming distance of two texts.

• Enhance speach13. Enhance speach provides function for
extracting useful speech signals from the noise background to suppress and reduce the noise interference
when the speech signal.
